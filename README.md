# Mkelsch-Code-Refactor

This Challenge was quite fun. The idea of the challenge was to simulate an On-the-job ticket, where a customer wants me to look over the html and css documents to clean things up. When I opened both documents, there was a lot of chaos. Many lines of css that were just duplicates of each other, and none of it was in an easy-to-read format. As for the html document, there were many issues of a different matter. Links didn't work, there were more class tags were needed, and the organization/indentation of the entire website was all a bit squished and hard to read. All this being the case, my job was to re-organize all the info, consolidate sections where I could, and make sure that all the hypertext links were working. All while not messing up the website. This challenge made the gears in my mind work by forcing me to find better ways of fixing issues without completely wiping the project and starting over. I had to think every step through, and plan ahead for what reactions could occur when deleting objects. Which also made me really understand the importance of pushing to github often. Without that, things can go wrong so quickly. I was somewhat aware of this prior to completing the challenge, but I in some ways underestimated it's overall importance. Needless to say, I am learning a lot of information and new things, and I am learning them quickly. Super grateful, and excited to see where things lead.
